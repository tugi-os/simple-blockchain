# Simple Blockchain

This repository is created for my personal learning journey in understanding blockchain structures using the Rust programming language. It includes simple implementations of various blockchain components that I develop as I learn. 

## Goals
- Grasp the fundamentals of building a blockchain from scratch.
- Improve my Rust skills along the way.

Feel free to follow along or contribute if you're interested in blockchain or Rust development!
